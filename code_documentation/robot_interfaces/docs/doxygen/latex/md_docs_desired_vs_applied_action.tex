The action given by the user is called the {\itshape desired} action. Depending on the implementation of the \hyperlink{classrobot__interfaces_1_1RobotDriver}{robot\+\_\+interfaces\+::\+Robot\+Driver}, this action may be altered before it is actually applied on the robot, e.\+g. by some safety checks limiting torque and maximum velocity. This altered action is called the {\itshape applied} action. You can use \hyperlink{classrobot__interfaces_1_1RobotFrontend_a870651d849fe0f1a4909820cc3b6de40}{robot\+\_\+interfaces\+::\+Robot\+Frontend\+::get\+\_\+applied\+\_\+action} to see what action actually got applied on the robot.
