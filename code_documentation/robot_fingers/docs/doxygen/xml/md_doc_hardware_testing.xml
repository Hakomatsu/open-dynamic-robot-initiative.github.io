</para><para>The <computeroutput>robot_fingers</computeroutput> package provides a script <computeroutput>single_finger_test.py</computeroutput> for testing basic functionality of a single Finger. After initialization, it holds all joints at their current position using position control. All available data is shown and constantly updated on the terminal:</para><para><image type="html" name="single_finger_test_curses.png">Screenshot of the curses interface showing the robot data.</image>
 <heading level="3">Running</heading>
</para><para>Start the application with the following command: <verbatim>rosrun robot_fingers single_finger_test.py
</verbatim></para><para>For this application, homing is done without end stops, that is the joints will simply home on the nearest encoder index without offset.</para><para>To quit simply press &quot;q&quot;.</para><para><heading level="3">Configuration</heading>
</para><para>The robot configuration used in application is found in <computeroutput>robot_fingers/config/single_finger_test.yml</computeroutput>. Typically the configuration should work well, however, you may need to adjust the CAN ports to match the ports on which the finger is connected. </para>    </detaileddescription>
